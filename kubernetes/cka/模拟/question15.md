Use context: kubectl config use-context k8s-c2-AC



Write a command into /opt/course/15/cluster_events.sh which shows the latest events in the whole cluster, ordered by time. Use kubectl for it.

Now kill the kube-proxy Pod running on node cluster2-worker1 and write the events this caused into /opt/course/15/pod_kill.log.

Finally kill the containerd container of the kube-proxy Pod on node cluster2-worker1 and write the events into /opt/course/15/container_kill.log.

Do you notice differences in the events both actions caused?
