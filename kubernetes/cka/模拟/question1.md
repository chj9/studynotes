You have access to multiple clusters from your main terminal through kubectl contexts. Write all those context names into /opt/course/1/contexts.

Next write a command to display the current context into /opt/course/1/context_default_kubectl.sh, the command should use kubectl.

Finally write a second command doing the same thing into /opt/course/1/context_default_no_kubectl.sh, but without the use of kubectl.
